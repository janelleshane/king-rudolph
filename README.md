> The world and joy of the sleigh
Santa baby bore sweet Jesus Christ

> The holly bears a berry,
And all the reindeer of the sky

> The holly bears a berry and reindeer
He was born today!

> And Santa baby bore sweet Jesus Christ,
And the chimney the angels sing.

> When the snowman brings the snow
Christmas tree
Letâ€™s take that road before
And Santa Claus comes tonight
He will bring us goodness and light

> Santa baby, a blitzen,
And he was the sun and reindeer and earth.
The Saviour of the chimney tonight

> The story of the chimney see
Santa baby, and blood and joyous so world and joy and good will to see
Santa baby bore sweet Jesus Christ
Fa la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la.

> King of toys and hippopotamuses [sic] full of the light of that stood at the dear Son of Santa Claus
He was born in a wonderful christmas tree

> Run, run Rudolph, run, run Rudolph, run, run Rudolph, run, run Rudolph, run, run Rudolph, run, run Rudolph, run, run Rudolph, run, run Rudolf the new born King.
